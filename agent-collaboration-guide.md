### Agent Coordination Patterns

#### Sequential Pattern (Linear Workflow)
```
Agent A → Agent B → Agent C → Agent D
```
**Best for**: Complex tasks requiring deep expertise at each stage
**Example**: Strategic Analysis → Implementation → Review → Documentation

```bash
# Example Sequential Workflow
Task(subagent_type: "5w2h-analyzer", prompt: "Analyze new feature requirements")
# → Use output for next step
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Implement based on analysis above")
# → Use output for next step
Task(subagent_type: "code-reviewer", prompt: "Review implementation above")
# → Use output for final step
Task(subagent_type: "documentation-manager", prompt: "Document approved implementation")
```

#### Parallel Pattern (Concurrent Analysis)
```
Input → [Agent A, Agent B, Agent C] → Synthesis
```
**Best for**: Multi-dimensional problems requiring different expertise
**Example**: Simultaneous technical, business, and process analysis

```bash
# Example Parallel Workflow
# All agents work simultaneously on the same problem
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Technical analysis of performance issue")
Task(subagent_type: "database-optimizer", prompt: "Database analysis of performance issue") 
Task(subagent_type: "5w2h-analyzer", prompt: "Process analysis of performance issue")
# → Combine insights from all three analyses
```

#### Orchestrated Pattern (Hub-and-Spoke)
```
Orchestrator Agent → [Multiple Specialized Agents] → Orchestrator → Output
```
**Best for**: Large, complex projects requiring coordination
**Example**: Enterprise project management

```bash
# Example Orchestrated Workflow
Task(subagent_type: "agile-master", 
     prompt: "Orchestrate development of new product feature involving:
     - Technical implementation (python-developer)
     - Quality assurance (code-reviewer)
     - Repository management (github-agent)
     - Documentation (documentation-manager)
     Coordinate all aspects and provide unified project management")
```

---

## Best Practices

### Proven Patterns for Agent Coordination

#### 1. Context Preservation Strategies

**Always Provide Rich Context**:
```bash
# ❌ Poor Context
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Fix the bug")

# ✅ Rich Context
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", 
     prompt: "Fix bug in user authentication system:
     - Issue: Users getting logged out after 5 minutes
     - Environment: Production Flask app with Redis sessions
     - Recent changes: Updated session middleware last week
     - Business impact: 40% user drop-off, critical priority
     - Requirements: Maintain current security standards")
```

**Reference Previous Agent Work**:
```bash
Task(subagent_type: "code-reviewer", 
     prompt: "Review the authentication fix implemented by python-developer above.
     Focus on security implications and session management best practices.
     Consider the business requirements and user impact mentioned in the original analysis.")
```

#### 2. Agent Specialization Optimization

**Match Tasks to Agent Strengths**:

| **Task Type** | **Best Agent** | **Why** |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| Strategic Planning | agile-master or 5w2h-analyzer | Strategic thinking and systematic analysis |
| Code Implementation | python-developer | Technical expertise and best practices |
| Quality Validation | code-reviewer | Security and quality focus |
| Process Improvement | scrum-master | Team dynamics and ceremony expertise |
| Repository Management | github-agent | GitHub API and workflow automation |
| Performance Issues | database-optimizer | Specialized performance knowledge |
| Documentation | documentation-manager | Technical writing expertise |

#### 3. Common Pitfalls to Avoid

**❌ Don't Do This**:
- Using general agents for specialized tasks
- Breaking coordination chains (losing context)
- Over-engineering simple problems
- Ignoring agent recommendations without explanation
- Mixing coordination patterns randomly

**✅ Do This Instead**:
- Choose the most specialized agent for each task
- Maintain context throughout agent chains
- Start simple, add complexity only when needed
- Act on agent recommendations or explain why not
- Use consistent coordination patterns within workflows

### Quality Assurance Integration

#### Systematic Quality Gates

**Every Development Workflow Should Include**:
1. **Requirements Analysis** (5w2h-analyzer or agile-master)
2. **Implementation** (python-developer or specialized technical agent)
3. **Quality Review** (code-reviewer - always include)
4. **Documentation** (documentation-manager for important changes)
5. **Integration** (github-agent for deployment)

```bash
# Quality-First Development Pattern
Task(subagent_type: "5w2h-analyzer", prompt: "Define quality requirements for [feature]")
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Implement with quality requirements from analysis above")
Task(subagent_type: "code-reviewer", prompt: "Comprehensive quality review of implementation")
Task(subagent_type: "github-agent", prompt: "Deploy with quality gates enforced")
```

#### Continuous Improvement Loop

**Regular Pattern for Team Growth**:
```bash
# Monthly Improvement Cycle
Task(subagent_type: "scrum-master", prompt: "Facilitate team retrospective covering last month's work")
Task(subagent_type: "5w2h-analyzer", prompt: "Analyze improvement opportunities from retrospective above")
Task(subagent_type: "agile-master", prompt: "Create improvement implementation plan from analysis")
Task(subagent_type: "documentation-manager", prompt: "Document improvements for organization knowledge base")
```

## Performance Optimization

### Maximizing Agent Effectiveness

#### Response Time Optimization

**Target Performance Metrics**:
- Simple operations: < 5 seconds
- Complex analysis: < 30 seconds  
- Multi-agent coordination: < 60 seconds
- Enterprise workflows: < 5 minutes

**Optimization Strategies**:

1. **Batch Related Requests**:
```bash
# ❌ Inefficient - Multiple separate calls
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Review file A")
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Review file B") 
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Review file C")

# ✅ Efficient - Single batched call
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", 
     prompt: "Review codebase changes including files A, B, and C
     Provide unified analysis and recommendations")
```

2. **Use Appropriate Detail Levels**:
```bash
# For quick decisions
Task(subagent_type: "code-reviewer", prompt: "Quick security scan of changes - flag only critical issues")

# For comprehensive analysis
Task(subagent_type: "code-reviewer", prompt: "Complete security audit with detailed recommendations")
```

3. **Leverage Agent Caching**:
```bash
# Reference previous work to avoid re-analysis
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", 
     prompt: "Build upon the architecture analysis from yesterday's session
     Focus on implementation details for user authentication module")
```

#### Workflow Efficiency Patterns

**High-Efficiency Coordination Patterns**:

```bash
# Pattern 1: Parallel Analysis with Synthesis
# Start multiple agents simultaneously
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Technical analysis of X")
Task(subagent_type: "database-optimizer", prompt: "Performance analysis of X")
Task(subagent_type: "code-reviewer", prompt: "Security analysis of X")
# Then synthesize results
Task(subagent_type: "5w2h-analyzer", prompt: "Synthesize above three analyses into action plan")

# Pattern 2: Specialized Chain Optimization
# Use the most appropriate agent at each step
Task(subagent_type: "5w2h-analyzer", prompt: "Strategic analysis")
→ Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Technical implementation based on strategy")
→ Task(subagent_type: "github-agent", prompt: "Deployment coordination based on implementation")
```

### Resource Management Strategies

#### Agent Load Balancing

**Distribute Work Appropriately**:
- Use **high-complexity agents** (agile-master, github-agent) for strategic work
- Use **medium-complexity agents** (code-reviewer, database-optimizer) for specialized technical work  
- Use **focused agents** (5w2h-analyzer) for specific methodological work

#### Monitoring and Optimization

**Regular Performance Reviews**:
```bash
# Monthly agent effectiveness review
Task(subagent_type: "5w2h-analyzer", 
     prompt: "Analyze our agent usage patterns over the last month
     Focus on: efficiency, outcomes, areas for improvement")

Task(subagent_type: "agile-master",
     prompt: "Optimize our agent coordination based on analysis above
     Create improved workflow patterns for next month")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Agent Coordination Issues

**Problem**: Agents losing context between interactions
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Always reference previous work explicitly
Task(subagent_type: "code-reviewer", 
     prompt: "Review the Python authentication module implemented by python-developer
     in the previous interaction. The module includes:
     [copy key details from previous response]
     Focus on security validation of the session management approach.")
```

**Problem**: Agent providing generic responses
**Solution**: 
```bash
# Provide specific, detailed context
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer",
     prompt: "Optimize database query performance for user dashboard:
     
     Current situation:
     - PostgreSQL 14, 1M+ user table
     - Query takes 2.3 seconds average
     - Heavy usage during 9-11 AM peak
     - Current query: SELECT * FROM users u JOIN profiles p ON u.id = p.user_id WHERE u.active = true
     
     Requirements:
     - Reduce query time to <200ms
     - Maintain data consistency
     - No changes to existing API
     
     Environment:
     - Django 4.2 ORM
     - Redis available for caching
     - Read replicas available")
```

#### Quality Issues

**Problem**: Inconsistent code quality
**Solution**: Always include code-reviewer in development workflows
```bash
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "[implementation task]")
Task(subagent_type: "code-reviewer", prompt: "Review implementation above with focus on:
- Security best practices
- Performance implications  
- Maintainability and documentation
- Compliance with team standards")
```

**Problem**: Missing documentation
**Solution**: Include documentation-manager in significant changes
```bash
Task(subagent_type: "documentation-manager",
     prompt: "Document the new authentication system implemented above:
     - API documentation
     - User guide updates
     - Technical architecture notes
     - Security considerations")
```

#### Process Issues

**Problem**: Teams struggling with Scrum adoption
**Solution**: Progressive agent support
```bash
# Start with scrum-master for ceremony basics
Task(subagent_type: "scrum-master", 
     prompt: "Help team establish basic Scrum ceremonies")

# Add 5w2h-analyzer for systematic improvement
Task(subagent_type: "5w2h-analyzer", 
     prompt: "Analyze Scrum adoption challenges and create improvement plan")

# Scale to agile-master for enterprise coordination
Task(subagent_type: "agile-master",
     prompt: "Coordinate Scrum scaling across multiple teams")
```

### Error Recovery Strategies

#### When Agents Fail to Respond

1. **Simplify the Request**:
```bash
# Instead of complex multi-part request
# Break into smaller, focused requests
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "First, analyze the code structure")
# Then build on the response
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Based on analysis above, suggest improvements")
```

2. **Try Alternative Agents**:
```bash
# If python-developer doesn't respond appropriately
# Try code-reviewer for code analysis
Task(subagent_type: "code-reviewer", prompt: "Analyze code quality and suggest improvements")
```

3. **Use Strategic Escalation**:
```bash
# Escalate to coordination agents
Task(subagent_type: "5w2h-analyzer", 
     prompt: "Analyze why we're having issues with [specific problem]
     and suggest alternative approaches")
```

### Performance Issues

#### When Responses Are Too Slow

1. **Reduce Request Complexity**:
```bash
# Instead of: "Complete analysis of entire system"
# Use: "Analyze authentication module only"
Task(subagent_type: "code-reviewer", prompt: "Focus security review on authentication module")
```

2. **Use Staged Approaches**:
```bash
# Stage 1: High-level analysis
Task(subagent_type: "5w2h-analyzer", prompt: "High-level problem analysis")
# Stage 2: Detailed investigation  
Task(subagent_type: "python-developer", prompt: "Detailed technical analysis of priority areas from above")
```
